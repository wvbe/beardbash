BEARDBASH
=============
This is a HTML/Javascript package that emulates a terminal window. It tries to catch any and all keyboard input and is able to send it to an API as a string. Usually, you'll want to echo the response.

The functions to send to the API and receive from the API are defined in the second and third argument of the BeardBash class constructor.
