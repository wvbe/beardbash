BEARDBASH
=============
This is a HTML/Javascript package that emulates a terminal window. It tries to catch any and all keyboard input and is able to send it to an API as a string. Usually, you'll want to echo the response.

To initiate a "window" create a new BeardBash object with at least one argument, the ID of the HTML element (with '#', as in CSS selector). You should be able to initialize more than one instance on the same page, as long as the ID's dont conflict.

The functions to send to the API and receive from the API are defined in respectively the second and third argument of the BeardBash class constructor.

You can use lessphp.php and beardbash.less in the css/ directory to compile a css file as follows

    php css/lessphp.php > css/beardbash.css

To-do's
-------
- Make HTML generated by BeardBash more customizable
- Check for cross-browser issues (only tested in Chroma, ha!)
- Remove console.logs
- Build a really awesome example with multiple windows
